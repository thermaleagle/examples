Slide 1

Title:
Evolving Our Branching Strategy: From Quarterly Releases to Trunk-Based Development

Bulleted Content (Subtitle or Body):

Addressing Merge Hell and Accelerating Delivery


Speaker Notes:

Welcome everyone. We’ll discuss our old quarterly release model, its challenges (“merge hell”), and how we plan to evolve toward trunk-based development.

This approach aims to speed releases, reduce conflicts, and align with modern DevOps.


Visual Placeholder & Suggestions:

Placeholder: Large title image or company logo.

Visual Idea: A simple cover image illustrating code branches merging or an abstract “technology/delivery” concept.

Alternatively, just your company/team logo for a clean, professional look.

Slide 2

Title:
Why Branching Strategy Matters

Bulleted Content:

Impacts release speed, code quality, and developer productivity

Integral to DevOps maturity and continuous delivery

Reduces integration conflicts and streamlines releases


Speaker Notes:

Emphasize how branching directly affects our ability to ship features quickly and reliably.

A good branching strategy simplifies merges, fosters collaboration, and increases confidence in the code.


Visual Placeholder & Suggestions:

Placeholder: Space for an icon-based infographic.

Visual Idea:

Icons or small images representing speed, quality, collaboration, risk reduction.

Could be arranged around a circle or in a horizontal line to visually summarize key benefits.

Slide 3

Title:
Our Old Quarterly Release Process

Bulleted Content:

Dedicated release branches (e.g., release/1.1.1) every quarter

Features branched off release branches, merged back

New release branches cut from the last release branch; rarely updated main

Source of truth lived in the most recent release branch


Speaker Notes:

Our historical model tied each quarterly release to its own branch.

main was neglected and not a true source of truth.

This caused multiple parallel branches, each diverging from each other.


Visual Placeholder & Suggestions:

Placeholder: A branching diagram showing how branches were created for each release.

Visual Idea:

A timeline or simple Git-like diagram:

Main line at the bottom (seldom updated)

Multiple release branches branching upward each quarter

Feature branches off those release branches.

Slide 4

Title:
Merge Hell & Cascading Conflicts

Bulleted Content:

Auto-merge cascades for hotfixes/features across multiple releases

Forward-porting changes from older to newer branches

Conflicts often required manual resolution

Large merges near deadlines = high risk


Speaker Notes:

The real pain: If you fix a bug in an older release branch, you must merge or “forward-port” it to all newer release branches.

Automatic merges frequently failed, causing time-consuming manual conflict resolution.


Visual Placeholder & Suggestions:

Placeholder: A “tangled branches” visual or a “merge conflict” cartoon.

Visual Idea:

A comedic or chaotic Git tree showing numerous lines crossing and merging, symbolizing “merge hell.”

Or a flowchart with arrows indicating merges from older to newer branches.

Slide 5

Title:
Our Current Branching Approach

Bulleted Content:

Shorter-lived feature branches

More frequent merges into a main or primary branch

Improved CI/CD adoption

Reduced merge conflicts, faster releases


Speaker Notes:

We’ve moved to more frequent merges instead of waiting until the quarter’s end.

Continuous Integration ensures that each merge is tested, reducing big-bang merges.


Visual Placeholder & Suggestions:

Placeholder: A simplified Git diagram showing fewer branches.

Visual Idea:

Illustrate short-lived feature branches merging quickly back into a central branch (e.g., “dev” or “main”).

Possibly include a small CI pipeline icon to show automatic testing.

Slide 6

Title:
Comparison to Popular Branching Models

Bulleted Content:

GitFlow: Complex merges, multiple long-lived branches

GitHub Flow: Main + short-lived branches, frequent merges

Trunk-Based: Very frequent merges to trunk, requires robust CI/feature flags

Our Current: Closer to GitHub Flow, not fully trunk-based


Speaker Notes:

Explain how these models differ in release cadence, merge complexity, and overhead.

We started near GitFlow but have since simplified.

Trunk-based is the most streamlined but demands a strong DevOps/CI foundation.


Visual Placeholder & Suggestions:

Placeholder: A comparison table or side-by-side bullet list.

Visual Idea:

Columns: GitFlow | GitHub Flow | Trunk-Based Dev | Our Current

Rows: Branch Lifetime, Release Cadence, Merge Complexity, Team Size Suitability, Overhead.

Slide 7

Title:
Why Aim for Trunk-Based Development

Bulleted Content:

Frequent small merges → fewer conflicts

Faster release cadence and immediate feedback

Feature flags to hide incomplete work

Aligned with modern CI/CD and DevOps


Speaker Notes:

Trunk-based dev means integrating code into a single branch multiple times a day.

Coupled with feature flags, you can merge incomplete features without risking production stability.

This fosters a truly continuous integration and delivery pipeline.


Visual Placeholder & Suggestions:

Placeholder: A minimal trunk-based diagram.

Visual Idea:

Show a single trunk line with small, short-lived branches that quickly merge back.

Highlight “Feature Flags” as a label or annotation to indicate how incomplete code is kept hidden.




---

Slide 8

Title:
Roadmap: Incremental Steps

Bulleted Content:

1. Shorten branch lifetimes further (daily merges)


2. Introduce or expand feature flagging


3. Strengthen automated testing and CI gates


4. Gradually retire dedicated release branches



Speaker Notes:

Adopting trunk-based development doesn’t have to be a big bang change.

Start by merging faster and using feature flags.

A robust test suite ensures safety in daily merges.

Release branches can be phased out over time.


Visual Placeholder & Suggestions:

Placeholder: A multi-stage timeline or phased diagram.

Visual Idea:

Four steps arranged horizontally or in a funnel, each labeled with the step number and key tasks.

Emphasize gradual transition to reduce risk.




---

Slide 9

Title:
Q&A and Next Steps

Bulleted Content:

Pilot trunk-based dev on a small project

Invest in CI/CD improvements (coverage, pipelines)

Developer training on daily merges & feature flags


Speaker Notes:

Encourage questions about feasibility, timelines, and potential blockers.

Summarize immediate actions: run a pilot, enhance CI, and train teams.

Stress that management buy-in and resource support are crucial for success.


Visual Placeholder & Suggestions:

Placeholder: “Any Questions?” or team photo background.

Visual Idea:

A simple Q&A slide with the same design theme, possibly a checklist graphic to represent the action items.

How to Use These Slides

1. Create a New PowerPoint and add nine slides.


2. Slide Titles: Paste the “Title” into the title placeholder for each slide.


3. Bulleted Content: Paste into the main text/body area.


4. Speaker Notes: Place them into the slide’s Notes pane.


5. Insert Visuals: Where you see “Visual Placeholder & Suggestions,” add actual diagrams, icons, or images.
