help us track eol Software & Hardware

Hi Team,

To ensure we stay ahead of end-of-life (EOL) risks for software and hardware in our department, weâ€™ve created a SharePoint list to track these assets and their remediation plans.

ðŸ“Œ What You Need to Do:

Add details of any EOL or soon-to-be EOL software/hardware in your area.

Update the remediation plan and target upgrade date where applicable.

Use this as a central reference to avoid disruptions and plan upgrades efficiently.

Your input will help us stay compliant, reduce risk, and ensure a smooth transition to updated technologies. Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,
